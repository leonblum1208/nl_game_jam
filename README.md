## How to play
The goal is to get Bodo through maze like levels in a factory. Base idea is to plan Bodo movements ahead and then execute them all at once.
- â€‹W-A-S-D for moving Bodo
- Q let Bodo sleep one round
- ENTER execute the entered commands
- BACKSPACE remove inputs
- You get more points the more movements you do in one go and the less energy you use. (Moving > Turning > Sleeping)
